# Minotar

A Minotar is a global avatar that pulls your head off your Minecraft.net skin, and allows it for use on several thousand sites - anywhere you can embed an image. See some uses below.

## Sweet and Simple API

### Simple Heads
Unlike the PayPal API, we keep things nice and simple. For basic usage just provide a username:

You can also set a size. We use pixels and we only need the width. Just add it to the end.

And since some services require an extension we've added simple support for it. Just add .png to the end.

### Avatar With Helm
Sometimes you want to display a helm too, that's fine with this endpoint.
